# McDonald's Customer Segmentation Analysis

This project focuses on **analyzing and segmenting McDonald's customers** based on their perceptions, preferences, and behaviors. Using **K-Means clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**, we identify distinct customer groups and evaluate how their opinions impact their purchasing decisions.

## Key Steps in the Analysis:
- **Data Preprocessing & Encoding** â€“ Converted categorical data (e.g., *"Like"* ratings) into numerical format for analysis.
- **Segment Extraction** â€“ Applied **K-Means** and **GMM** to identify customer segments.
- **Segment Profiling** â€“ Created **bar charts and box plots** to visualize key characteristics of each segment.
- **Gender & Age Distribution** â€“ Used **mosaic plots and box plots** to describe segment differences by gender and age.
- **Visit Frequency & Customer Preferences** â€“ Analyzed how often different customer segments visit McDonald's and how much they like it.
- **Marketing Mix Customization** â€“ Suggested targeted strategies (**Price, Product, Promotion, and Place**) to better serve each segment.
- **Evaluation & Monitoring** â€“ Emphasized the importance of **continuous tracking** to adjust strategies based on market changes.

## Key Insights:
âœ… **Some segments love McDonald's for taste but find it expensive, requiring budget-friendly product options.**  
âœ… **Visit frequency and preferences vary across segments, guiding personalized marketing approaches.**  
âœ… **Demographic factors (age, gender) influence customer opinions, helping refine promotional strategies.**  
âœ… **Continuous monitoring is necessary as customer needs and market conditions evolve.**  

This analysis helps **McDonald's better understand its customer base, refine marketing strategies, and drive long-term brand loyalty.** ðŸš€
